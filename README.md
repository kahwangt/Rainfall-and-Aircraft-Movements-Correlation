# Rainfall and Aircraft Movements Correlation
In conjunction with final project for FIT5147 - Data Exploration & Visualisation unit where one is required to explore open data sets and identify trends and patterns for potential stakeholders using data visualisation techniques.

Studied the correlation between annual average rainfall and annual average aircraft movements in 8 major Australian airports, namely Adelaide, Brisbane, Canberra, Gold Coast, Melbourne, Perth, Sydney and Tasmania over the time period from 2009 to 2016

Performed data cleaning and data wrangling on R to make data ready for visualisation

Implemented the 5 Design Sheet Methodology to explore best feasible visualisation option for presentation of information

Designed interactive visualisation using D3.js that allows user to filter between the location and year quarter to identify correlation on aircraft movements and average rainfall

Scored a High Distinction for the clear interactive visualisation web page that allows user to fully grasp the intended message in a concise and precise manner
